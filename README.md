# Design Challenge - Blockchain at Berkeley
>Welcome to the design challenge for future B@B designers!
>Select at least one of the following tasks and show us what you're capable of!

## Requirements
For each challenge, you must have some kind of visual deliverable, whether it's in PDF, AI or other format. You can use whatever software you want. We tend to use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Sketch. Additionally, for any of the tasks, you must have a folder of inspiration (minimum 5 pieces of inspiration) that you save and submit along with the the rest of your design. We recommend using Dribbble: https://dribbble.com/

## Tasks

### Re-design the Blockchain at Berkeley Consulting Brochure
Blockchain at Berkeley's consulting branch get's so many inbound queries from top companies like Qualcomm, Airbus and other company we are not allowed to disclose. You can see our current document and information [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HJx8YuuFNkUJl523_WfuhaWQCp3VM0jv/view?usp=sharing). Given this, come up with a better way to convey the same information. Don't just copy and paste text and slightly improve the text, come up with very visual ways to convey the same information and make it impressive. However, make sure most of the information is  Even making the cover amazing is a huge boost. Ultimately we want to see some kind of consistent visual hierarchy that can be used for any documents. 

### BlockBytes Branding Design Task 
Consider an initiative, BlockBytes, to create high quality, digestible, informative video content explaining blockchain related concepts. These videos would range from around 3-5 minutes in length. There is a huge gap in the market right now for videos of this nature, explaining these complex concepts to the general public hungry for blockchain knowledge, thus we would read a wide audience with these videos. 

Create one the following for this BlockBytes: 
1) Logo and One Illustration Art (using the latest trends in design)
2) Animated intro title sequence (max 15 seconds)

### 2D Graphic Animation
B@B's Education division is looking for something that showcases your graphic animation skills as best as possible. We'd expect you to put together some graphics in a vector based designer like Sketch or Illustrator and move it over to After Effects as a standard process, or experiment with some cutting-edge sketch plugins to animate. This is only a suggestion for how to do it, but the end result should be something trendy, beautiful and short. Here's an example of exceptional work: https://dribbble.com/shots/2592912-Every-wildnight

We don't expect this tier of work but if you can get anywhere close that's our expectations. Feel free to keep it simple or complex as you want.

### Graphic Design Task
A make-believe blockchain tech company Argus that works on Enterprise blockchain with Raft consensus and easier smart contracts by having Python based smart contracts. They are looking for someone to come up with a brand for their 100M funded startup. Design one very strong illustration that could be used to show off something related to their product. Don't worry about tangentially being related to the company as long as you try to get it close - we don't expect you to understand how Raft consensus to work but you should be able to design something tangentially related to what this company does. 

The client wants something more trendy and sleek (think consistent color/gradient schemes). Also if you have a visual hierarchy to help sell the client on your design language and inspire your client you will get bonus points. You can use typefaces to convey the product. Assume that we are optimizing for wow-factor.

### Web Design Task
Blockchain at Berkeley has been in the process of redesigning our website. However, we are still trying to figure out a design language that sticks and we really love the logo colors and want to experiment with other combinations while maintain *some* of the logo's heritage. Check out what we're starting to work on here: https://berkeleyblockchain.github.io/

Create a new front page with an impressive design language by making a realistic mockup. Take into account layout, visual design and what content should be presented. You will be evaluated on all of these.
